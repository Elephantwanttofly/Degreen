### INTRODUCTION

DeGreen is an application that can detect soil type and recommend plants that are suitable for that soil. This application aims to help people who want to start gardening and make it easier to choose plants that suit the soil conditions in their environment

### ABOUT APP

We build our android application to give information to users about soil and result Detection From Machine learning which we get from cloud API. Our application workflow starts with accessing a phone camera which can take photos of the soil, then the application can provide information about what plants are suitable for the soil. For each plant, there will be a link to purchase that plant.
