# **DeGreen**
DeGreen is an innovative app designed for public use, offering a soil detection feature that simplifies plant selection. Users can effortlessly identify suitable plants for their soil type by simply capturing a photo using the in-app camera. This tool streamlines the process, aiding users in making informed planting decisions based on soil analysis.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning solution for rapid and accurate soil detection. The models are trained on a dataset containing images of various soil types. The trained models can then be used to classify the type of soil in input images.

### Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive soil type dataset, which includes images of different soil varieties. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to enhance the diversity and size of the training data. Data augmentation techniques such as rescaling, rotation, and flipping are applied to the images. After we collected the dataset manually from various sources, we got a total of 3.118 datasets.

Consisting 5 soil types to classify, including :
Alluvial Soil
Clay Soil
Cinder Soil
Black Soil
Red Soil

### Model Training

The machine learning models are trained using the augmented dataset. The training process involves the use of CNN architectures and various deep-learning techniques. The models are evaluated for accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.

### Results

The trained models demonstrate high accuracy in classifying soil types. The project also includes the evaluation of the models using testing data and the presentation of accuracy metrics. The results showcase the effectiveness of the machine-learning solution for soil detection.

### Future Work

In the future, the project aims to further improve the models' performance and explore additional techniques for soil classification. This may involve the integration of other data sources and the enhancement of model generalization.
